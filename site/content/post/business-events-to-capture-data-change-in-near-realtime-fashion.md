  Scenario: Update Care and Inventory Manager item status once it's running out.
  Send email notification to Inventory Manager.

**Solution**: 



**Enhancement**: to populate Care a dialog showing that item is running out, with specific QtyOnHand, QtyOnSOBooked, SO inquiring such with SO# and requested QtyOrdered, etc.

This needs to be handled over customization code.
