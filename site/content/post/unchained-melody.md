A Complete IDE Running in the Cloud

While Gitpod keeps the convenience and accessibility of online coding playgrounds and sandboxes, it is not a toy but a complete dev environment running in the cloud.

We teamed-up with Google, Ericsson, Arm and Red Hat to develop the open-source project Eclipse Theia. The project puts VS Code’s state-of-the-art technology and UX into the browser based on an extensible architecture that is optimized for the cloud.

Gitpod already comes with several VS Code extensions pre-installed (such as Go support from Microsoft’s own extension). We will be adding more popular VS Code extensions shortly, and later allow users to define any extensions they want.

In addition to one of the best code editors, Gitpod environments provide full featured terminals backed by Linux containers running in the cloud. As a result, you get the same command line tools you would use locally together with the hottest IDE tech available today. And all of that in a browser tab.
